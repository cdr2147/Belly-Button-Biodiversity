# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
## Overview
A researcher is working to discover bacteria that syntesize proteins that taste like beef and has partnered with a startup, Improbable Beef, to research bacteria. The researcher is specifically interested in bacteria that is found in the human bellybutton. After the data is collected, you are asked to assist with creating visualizations and a dashboard to make the data available to research participants and fellow researchers.

## Purpose
You are asked to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Results
Using Javascript, Plotly, and D3.js, we create an interactive dashboard where users can see visualizations of bacterial data based on individual research participants.
